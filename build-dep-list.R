# file: build-dep-list.R
#
# This script is used to get the source (.tar.gz) files for R packages and
# recursive dependencies so that the source files can be transfered to, and
# installed on, machines without internet access.
#
# The result of this script will place source files (.tar.gz) for the packages,
# and the package dependencies, and dependencies of dependencies, and so on, in
# the pkg-source-files directory.
#
# A makefile will be generated to install the packages.
#
# Moving the pkg-source-files directory, and the makefile via FTP
# to the target machine should be sufficient for installing on that machine,
# assuming that R and GNU make have been successfully installed on that machine.
#
# This script is expected to be evaluated from the command line via:
#
#   Rscript --vanilla build-dep-list.R [pkg1] [pkg2] [...] [pkgn]
#
# Where pkg1 is the name of the first known package to download, pkg2 the second
# known package to download, ..., and pkgn the nth package to download.  The
# script will download all the dependencies for pkg1, ..., pkgn, and the
# dependencies of the dependencies, and so on.
#
# Alternatively,
#
#  Rscript --vanilla build-dep-list.R needed-pkgs.txt
#
# where needed-pkgs.txt is a file listing the pkg1, pkg2, ..., pkgn.
#
# **EXAMPLE** you need the following three packages:
#
# 1. ggplot2
# 2. qwraps2
# 3. data.table
#
# One way to do this:
#
#     Rscript --vanilla build-dep-list.R ggplot2 qwraps2 data.table
#
# or
#
#    echo -e "ggplot2\nqwraps2\ndata.table" > needed-pkgs.txt
#    Rscript --vanilla build-dep-list.R needed-pkgs.txt
